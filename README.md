# Instant Slideshow
Hack OHIO 2016 project 

# Project Discription
Make an app or website that makes a slideshow for you as you talk. Approach:

- Use [Google Cloud Speech API](https://cloud.google.com/speech/) to recognize the words that presenter is saying.
- Pipe the words to Flickr to get nice images
- Automatically create fancy, animated slides with nice images and important words/transitions.
- Have a **meme** percentage to give your slides more pizazz!
